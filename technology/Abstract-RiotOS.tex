\section{RIOT OS}

RIOT is a compact operating system for IoT devices. Its developed
by open source community co-founded by INRIA.\ RIOT fits IOT
hardware constraints in terms of memory which ranges around 1.5 kb
of RAM and 4 kb of ROM.\ It provides comfort of programming similar
to linux.

RIOT addresses several IoT device resource constraints like Kernel
performance and system level interportability. It is energy efficient,
has low latency interrupt handling and supports multithreading.

Features of RIOT OS:\
\begin{itemize}
	\item  Standard programming in C or C++
   	\item  Standard tools such as gcc, gdb
	\item  Minimized hardware dependent code
	\item  Multi-threading with ultra-low threading overhead 
   	\item  Static and dynamic memory allocation
	\item  Code footprint flexibility, Robustness
\end{itemize}~\cite{hid-sp18-522-riot}
